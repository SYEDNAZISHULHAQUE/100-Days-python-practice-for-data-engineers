# 🚀 100 Days Python Practice for Data Engineers

A hands-on Python practice repository built specifically for **Data Engineers**.  
This repository focuses on real-world data engineering use cases using Python, with logic that closely aligns with SQL queries, PySpark transformations, and ETL pipelines.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this repository is to help data engineers strengthen Python fundamentals by solving practical problems commonly encountered in data pipelines.  
Each topic is organized into its own folder, and each folder contains **one Python file** with multiple problems and well-documented solutions.

The problems are designed to improve:
- Data processing logic
- SQL-style thinking
- PySpark-style transformations
- ETL workflow understanding

## 📂 Modules Included

Python Basics for Data Engineers  
Contains 15 problems covering core Python concepts frequently used in data engineering, such as loops, conditionals, dictionaries, lists, modular code, and validations.

File Handling (CSV, JSON, Parquet)  
Contains 15 problems focused on reading, writing, validating, and converting data across common file formats used in data pipelines.

Data Cleaning & Validation  
Contains 15 problems related to handling null values, removing duplicates, validating schemas, enforcing business rules, and standardizing data.

Transformations & Aggregations  
Contains 15 problems covering filtering, grouping, sorting, aggregations, derived columns, and metric calculations.

SQL-like Logic in Python  
Contains 10 problems that recreate SQL concepts such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN, HAVING, and ORDER BY using Python logic.

PySpark-style Thinking (Python-based)  
Contains 10 problems designed to build intuition for PySpark DataFrame operations using pure Python.

Testing, Logging, and Configurations  
Contains 10 problems demonstrating unit testing, logging, exception handling, assertions, and configuration management.

Mini ETL Tasks  
Contains 10 end-to-end ETL-style exercises combining extraction, transformation, validation, aggregation, and loading logic.

## 🛠️ How to Use

Navigate to any module folder  
Open the Python file inside  
Read the problem statement written as comments  
Understand the solution and inline explanations  
Modify or extend the code for practice  

## 🎓 Who This Is For

Aspiring Data Engineers  
Python developers transitioning into data engineering  
Engineers preparing for data engineering interviews  
Professionals working with SQL, PySpark, and ETL pipelines  

## ⭐ Final Note

This repository is meant for **practice and learning**, not just reading.  
Try rewriting solutions, optimizing logic, and converting patterns into PySpark code as an exercise.
